# RainLED
This is to be used with a Raspberry Pi in order to create a 5x5 led matrix of rain data. Useful as a decoration.
It is currently a work in progress. I have done limited testing, but in theory, it should 
work in other locations, whilst dynamically selecting the best weather station to represent each led.

The data is currently just outputted to the console every 15 minutes, along with a timestamp
If 'log' is passed as an argument, this program will log data to a logs.txt file every 15 minutes.
