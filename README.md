# RainLED
This is to be used with a Raspberry Pi in order to create a 3x3 led matrix of weather data. Useful as a decoration.
It is currently a work in progress. I have not tested any locations other than West Lafayette, IN, but in theory, it should
work in other locations, whilst dynamically sorting the 9 closest stations into their appropriate locations, given the right
location.

If 'log' is passed as an argument, this program will log data to a logs.txt file every 15 minutes.
